  <p>
    This report is updated automatically each day to highlight key insights from the Mosquito Alert Barcelona platform.
    It focuses on the 7-day-ahead forecast of the Vector Risk Index (VRI) for tiger mosquitoes (<em>Aedes albopictus</em>) in Barcelona.
    This provides a relative measure of the variation in the risk of human contact with tiger mosquitoes across Barcelona and over time.
    The 7-day-ahead forecast (which starts on the current day) is based on the weather forecast provided daily by the Meteorological Service of Catalonia.
    The VRI forecast is updated between 11:30 am and 12:30 pm each day.

  <h4>City-Wide Trends</h4>
  <p>
    During the next 7 days, the report summarizes the mean and maximum VRI in Barcelona.
    Figure 1 shows the mean and maximum values estimated for each day, starting 30 days ago and extending 7 days ahead of today.

  <h4>District VRI</h4>
  <p>
    Figure 2 shows mean VRI estimates for each of Barcelona's districts for the next 7 days.
    The means mask spatial variation within districts, so Figure 3 shows the distribution of VRI estimates (pooled across the next 7 days) at 20m resolution for each district.
    Districts are ordered according to their median VRI and the city-wide median is shown with the vertical red line.

  <h4>Neighborhood VRI</h4>
  <p>
    Figure 4 shows mean VRI estimates for each of Barcelona's neighborhoods during the next 7 days.
    As with the district means, the neighborhood means mask considerable spatial variation.
    Figure 5 shows the distribution of VRI estimates (pooled across the next 7 days) at 20m resolution for each neighborhood.
    Neighborhoods are ordered according to their median VRI and the city-wide median is shown with the vertical red line.
