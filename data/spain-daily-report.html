    This report is updated automatically each day to highlight key insights from the MosquitoAlertES platform.
    It focuses on the 6-day-ahead forecast of the Vector Risk Index (VRI) for tiger mosquitoes (<em>Aedes albopictus</em>) in Spain.
    This provides a relative measure of the variation in the risk of human contact with tiger mosquitoes across Spain and over time.
    The 6-day-ahead forecast (which starts on the current day) is based on the weather forecast provided daily by the Spanish Meteorological Agency.
